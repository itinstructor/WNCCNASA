# Dexter Industries Distance Sensor example for the GoPiGo3
#
# This example shows a basic example to read sensor data from the Dexter Industries Distance Sensor.  This sensor is a white PCB.
#
# Connect the Dexter Industries Distance Sensor to an I2C port on the GoPiGo3.
# Have a question about this example?  Ask on the forums here:
# http://forum.dexterindustries.com/c/gopigo

import time                             # Import the time library for the sleep function
import easygopigo3 as easy              # Import the GoPiGo3 library
gpg = easy.EasyGoPiGo3()                # Initialize an EasyGoPiGo3 object

# Initialize an object of the Distance Sensor class.
# I2C1 and I2C2 are just labels used for identifying the port on the GoPiGo3 board.
# Technically, I2C1 and I2C2 are the same thing, so we don't have to pass any port to the constructor.
my_distance_sensor = gpg.init_distance_sensor()

        # Read the sensor data into millimeters and inches variables
        mm = str(my_distance_sensor.read_mm())
        inches = str(my_distance_sensor.read_inches())

        # Print the values of the sensor to the console
        print("Distance Sensor Reading: " + inches + " inches " + mm + " mm")

        # sleep is only needed to see the measurements
        # sleep is blocking code, nothing else can happen during sleep
        # Don't use in production code
        time.sleep(1)


# If a standalone program, call the main function
# Else, use as a module
