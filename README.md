## mBot Examples
- These examples are from our Intro to Robotics class. The shape or concept of the code can be used as starting points for your GoPiGo3 programs.
## Code Examples
#### All code works with Python 3.5 or above
- Original program code from GoPiGo3 file system, or https://github.com/DexterInd/GoPiGo3
- /Dexter/Software/Python/Examples/
- blinkers.py --> Turn the blinkers on the front on and off
- dex_eyes.py --> Turn the led's on the top (robot eyes) to different colors
- distance_sensor.py --> Read the distance sensor to the console
- motors.py --> Dead reckoning movement
- obstacle_avoidance --> Obstacle avoidance with distance sensor
